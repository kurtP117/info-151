            <h2>Tic Tac Toe (Python)</h2>
            <p>
              I developed a fully functional command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python, featuring a user-friendly interface and clear turn-based logic. The program allows two players to compete with alternating moves and checks for win conditions after every turn. This project strengthened my understanding of control flow, functions, and input validation.

            <h2>Bank Simulator (Java)</h2>
            <p>
              This Java-based bank simulation project models core banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance tracking. I used object-oriented programming principles to structure the application efficiently with multiple classes and robust input handling. This project improved my Java skills and helped me better understand real-world financial systems.

            <h2>Finish Tech Corp Website (Wix)</h2>
            <p>
              For my employer, I designed and launched a professional website using Wix, focusing on product presentation, branding, and user experience. I structured product categories, integrated media, and optimized layout and navigation for mobile and desktop users. Though built with Wix, I played a key role in UI decisions, content creation, and performance tuning.
